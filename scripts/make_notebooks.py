"""Author the Module 3 notebooks.

Notebooks are data, and hand-editing JSON invites drift, so every notebook is
generated here and committed. Regenerate after edits:

    python3 scripts/make_notebooks.py

STATUS: only two notebooks are generated. Part 2's demonstrates that a page can
hand a student a live Colab notebook, and Part 6's is the from-scratch starter.
Parts 3 to 5 carry a notebook slot on the page instead, since a second, third
and fourth empty notebook demonstrate nothing the first one has not.

The full six-job versions of notebooks 1 through 4 are preserved on the
`full-build-archive` branch. They were cut because how technique gets taught in
this module is an open question that belongs to the practitioner who will write
these, not to the scaffolding.

What each notebook keeps: a working setup cell that loads the real hosted CSV,
so the "open in Colab" link works end to end and the format is demonstrable.
Everything after the setup cell is open space.
